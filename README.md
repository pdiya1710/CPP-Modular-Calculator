📌 Overview

This project is an Object-Oriented Calculator implemented in C++.
It is designed to help beginners understand OOP concepts such as classes, methods, and encapsulation, along with basic arithmetic operations.

The calculator uses a simple console-based interface.

- Addition

- Subtraction

- Multiplication

- Division

- Object-Oriented design using classes

- Division-by-zero handling

- Clean and readable code structure

🛠 Technologies Used

- Language: C++

- Compiler: g++ (GCC)

🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing classes and objects in C++

- Using methods for arithmetic operations

- Applying switch-case logic

- Handling runtime errors (division by zero)

- Writing clean, modular code

🔧 Future Improvements

- Add scientific operations

- Implement menu-driven looping

- Add file-based calculation history

- Convert to GUI using Qt
